// When looking at his code I noticed how neat and compact everything is.
// Another thing is when looking  at his code you can tell that he put his
// all into it because you can see the amount of work he did to get his
// website as close as possible to the example they gave us. When switching
// from light and dark mode you can tell how much time went into the css
// because to get it looking like that you have to take your time because
// one wrong input can mess up the whole website. OverAll Jacob did a
// really good job on this assignment and should be proud of the work he did.
